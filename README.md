# Celebrity-classification
**Overview**
This project aims to create a web application that classifies celebrities from images using a machine learning model. The project leverages OpenCV for image processing, a machine learning model for classification, Flask for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

**Features**
Image Upload: Users can upload images of celebrities.
Celebrity Classification: The uploaded image is processed and classified to identify the celebrity.
Result Display: The classification result, along with relevant information about the celebrity, is displayed on the frontend.

**Technologies Used**
Machine Learning: Python, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn
Backend: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Setup and Installation**

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Flask
OpenCV
Scikit-Learn
HTML, CSS, JavaScript knowledge

**Usage**

Project Details**
Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model is responsible for classifying the uploaded images. It is built using OpenCV for image processing and a machine learning framework like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or Keras for building and training the model. The trained model is saved as model.h5.

Backend (Flask)
The backend is built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework. The Flask app handles the image upload, processes the image using the machine learning model, and returns the classification result to the frontend.

Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and displaying the classification results
